This repository contains a proof of concept.

To run the project locally:

- make sure you are running a recent version of Python
- create a virtual environment
- in that virtual environment install the dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- move into the project_lexicon folder and run `python manage.py runserver` to start a local server

For some of the scripts one first needs to clone the data repositories from github. These repositories 
are mentioned in the .gitignore file.

The data used in this repository have their own licenses so please verify and download the
unfoldingWord data such as the en_ULT and the hbo_uhb.

This project is not actively maintained, but feel free to create an issue in order to find out
more about the project.
